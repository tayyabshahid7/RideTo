I’m a complete newbie to riding on a scooter - but he was patient, calm, and gave me the extra time and support that I needed to gain enough confidence to go out on the road. I loved it so much I purchased my first scooter that evening. I would highly recommend iPass from an instruction point of view - Charles was great. Only downside for me were the facilities - I was a little surprised on my arrival at the centre that it was based in a car park and so access to toilets/changing areas depended on the building next door being open - which is fine if you don’t run overtime like I did!",

His knowledge, experience, patience, way of explaining, demonstrating and sense of humour were spot on. \r\n\r\nFrom never ridden a scooter before - to full control of a manual 125cc in few hours time.\r\n\r\nWorth mentioning that when mistakes were made (as normal), not only that he had a brilliant way in explaining and demonstrating how to execute the maneuver correctly, but also a fantastic way to relax the riders.\r\n\r\nShame he does not give lessons for DAS yet; but I'll certainly call back in few months - a year time to check-in. \r\n\r\nThanks Jules!

After a short assessment ride on a 125cc I did two days on a Honda CB650F where we practiced for MOD1 and MOD2. Next day I passed my MOD1 test with flying colours, that’s again thanks to Nathan as he made us practice the exercises on a somewhat smaller scale, so on the actual test everything felt spacious. (You’ll appreciate this when you have to do the slalom, U turn or swerve.) I only passed my MOD2 test for the second try, but to be fair failing it for the first time was all on me. (Little tip, don’t cut in front of a lorry on your test haha)\r\nI would say don’t be discouraged by some of the bad reviews here, that’s usually from people who can’t even pass their CBT and/or are a danger to themselves and other road users.",

Martin, Ian, Ewan and Jason all trained me at various times. They are all highly experienced riders who know their bikes, riding and racing like no other school I've been to.\r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time here and would reccomend anyone and everyone to give them a call. Their calm, comedic and expert instruction is well worth your time and money. They talk you through the gear, bikes, shops and everything else to make you feel safe, knowledgeable well inducted into the biking world. Can't fault them.\r\n\r\nGraham, the owner, is also incredibly accommodating.\r\n\r\n10/10, would buy them all a pint if I ever have the pleasure of running into them again.\r\n\r\nNick\r\nMaths Teacher, London.",

Even though I have been riding a geared motorbike for more than 14 years now, he made sure that all the processes/rules are followed and he gave the right tips every time. He was simply great to talk to as well...Inspiring, motivational for some weak riders on the day.\r\nI am definitely going back to them for getting a full license. Jason [another great guy] on big bikes explained the process very nicely. I hope he is my instructor for the big bikes as well.\r\nTotally recommend this place due to the passionate people out there. You will leave the place happy. trust me!",

            "I would like to thank Graham and Ian for working with me and getting me through my module 1 and module 2 tests. \r\n\r\nI passed both tests first time making 1 minor mistake in my module 1 test and 2 minor faults in my module 2 test making it 3 minor faults altogether. \r\n\r\nIan was my instructor whilst I was there and is an absolute genius at his job and will get anyone with a bit of common sense through any of the tests first time around. He's extremely passionate about bikes and about what he does for a living. I fully enjoyed every lesson with Ian and always learnt something new about bikes and about the skills required to pass the tests and to keep myself safe whilst riding. Ian is a very patient instructor and very easy to get on with. Thank you Ian for making me into a real biker!! hahaha\r\n\r\nI would also like to thank Graham once again for having the little talk with me before I set off for my module 2 test. The conversation we had really did help calm my nerves a little and put me into the correct frame of mind to pass my test.\r\n\r\nFinally I would just like to recommend to anyone wishing to get on 2 wheels to not think about it for too long like I did and just give Alpha motorcycle training a call immediately. Alpha motorcycle training is the greatest school within the Wembley and surrounding areas and I guarantee you wont find anyone better or cheaper. 3 minor faults altogether is a great result and I couldn't have gotten through these tests without the help from Alpha motorcycle training.\r\n\r\nOnce again thank you to everyone at Alpha motorcycle training and I will see you guys again soon.",

Passed everything first time - even when I didn't have to confidence in myself I was constantly reassured and given clear, honest instruction. They are always professional and organised. I'd recommend to anyone who wants to learn to ride a bike of any shape or size. I couldn't be happier that I chose this company.",

They are a fantastic set of instructors with a lot of patience and helped me get a license with only 6 hours of instruction which was top notch in quality. Very friendly and will be coming back for advanced training later on down the line.\r\nCheers guys !",

The course was very thorough and never at any point did I feel that we wasn’t getting anything but the highest quality of training. I was feeling quite anxious at first but I was made to feel at ease and never rushed . When it came to on road training again very professional and thorough.",

He also tried his best to calm down new riders nerves.\r\n\r\nI have already recommeded two other friends last year and continue to do so, I always feel comfortable and confident with the universal team!\r\n\r\nI was bit disappointed that no discount is given for riders who have come back to universal for renewal.

I came to this training centre after a bad experience doing a CBT course at aanother training centre in East Ham. At Universal I've found the most professional and prepared instructors I could have asked for. I initially did a private two-hours lesson with Rashid, such a patient and encouraging instructor that helped me grow my confidence. Lovely Vicky booked me in for my CBT two weeks after. I did the training with Mario, which proved to be the most motivating and prepared instructor ever! The training went really well. The theory part was detailed and well presented on a huge screen, the practical training never felt rushed and every exercise was explained thoroughly, and the road part felt very safe and controlled despite the rain. I'm happy I did my CBT at Universal and I'm planning to continue my training with them as soon as I'll feel ready. A big THANK YOU!",

The instructors on the day Sam and Dan were great! Really friendly, patient and professional. Its been 17 years since ive been on a bike so was a little nervous to start but they both made me feel comfortable and relaxed the whole time and I passed with ease! Thanks again guys!\r\n\r\nKirk",

Rode a well kept CB650F in a controlled area, Steve was brilliant! very calm, polite and informative. I was so chuffed after my assessment. I cannot wait to book my DAS with the guys.\r\n\r\nthe FREE full motorcycle assessment is a brilliant idea and give you an insight/taste into riding a bigger which leaves you wanting more!

            "Just completed my progression from an A2 licence to the full category A unrestricted, offered me a nice 2 day package, first day including a brush up training for both mod 1 and 2 and the second morning having both the test back to back, only training who was able to give me these dates in a week and a half in advance. Training was good and informative, straight to the point and no wasting time, instructors are friendly and very helpful, a nice space to practice a mod1 mock test and also good knowledge regarding test routes for the mod2 which I was able to ride through before hand, all in all definitely recommend to anyone, added bonus it was also one of the cheaper quotes than I was offered from other schools",

            "Got my motorcycle license after 5 days of training here. The teachers are friendly, helpful and patient.0\r\n\r\nThe bikes are all Suzuki for the A license, and mixed brands for CBT. I wouldn't comment about the CBT bikes as they are used everyday by newbies so the quality can't be expected too much. The 600cc bikes are all V twin so lots of torque low end and easy to ride for nervous beginners who wouldn't want to twist the acceleration too much. However, make sure you get one of the newest bikes for your mod 2 test as they are less used, have lighter clutch and have anti-stall function. You're normally assigned one anyway but just make sure to ask.\r\n\r\nClasses and exams are usually fully booked during summer months. I had to wait 1 month after passing my mod 1 test to be able to take mod 2. Probably booking them all in advance if you're confident will save some waiting time.",

Christine made the CBT part smooth and easy, and Leo was fantastic for my DAS course, always calm and professional no matter how badly we rode.  I initially thought it was expensive but it's typical for London and given the ~7 hours of 1:2 instruction per day it's actually pretty good value for money.  Even better, they even arranged for me to borrow a 125cc bike for free for a day just to get some more riding experience in which made all the difference.  Totally recommended.",

            "Couldn’t be happier about my riding experience with A2Z, taking my DAS and passing MOD1/MOD2 first time. From the moment you book your course with Tina over the phone, you know you’ve made the right choice. Tina is considerate and always trying to help, managing course times around your schedule. \r\nOnce you start your course things get even better. I was training with Rob who not only has bucket loads of experience, but is also a great guy to spend time with, making the training days very enjoyable and educational. Rob trains you well above test standards and prepares you for every elements of both tests. In parallel to my training with Rob, I also had the pleasure of spending time with Shane who made sure everyone was having a good time and sharing his own perspective on the test.\r\nAll in all, a great team and a fantastic atmosphere. In fact, even in the stress-inducing environment that is the test centre waiting room, you could easily tell Rob and Shane were the two instructors there with the most rapport with their students (by a mile..). \r\nI passed MOD1/MOD2 first time and on the same day, and would recommend A2Z to anyone interested in taking their test. Thanks team!",

            "The instructors were beyond experienced. Stuart is an ex-examiner, and knows what he's chatting about. Rob was an ex-police motorcycle rider and I think he had more years under his belt than I've been alive!!\r\nI'm pretty sure the school is the only one that allows you to practice on the Mod1 site the Sunday before your test. So you're literally test-ready not suggestively test ready.\r\nOf the 3 others I did my Mod1 with 3 of us got no minors and the other guy got 1.\r\n\r\nThey prepare you for the Mod2 thoroughly basically testing your testable ability on every road ride and providing truly thorough feedback on your ride.\r\n\r\nI can't fault them, they block book so if you pass your mod1, you'll be taking your mod2 the same day 😊\r\n\r\nUltimately I passed, so I have much love for this school!!",

            "Great riding school, managed to get me through both Mod1 and Mod2 from the first time. I wasn't great on a bike before the course, so I took the longer version. Tina managed to adjust the schedule to help with work and I started very soon, which fit just right. The plan was to learn a lot and pass the tests before my theory test expired, two days after the Mod1/2 date. Thanks to the great instruction from Shane it all worked out perfectly.\r\nThe bikes are quite new and easy to handle. Also, practicing on the exam location helped a lot, both for Mod1 and Mod2. I'd have probably failed on the swerve of Mod1 if I hadn't done it several times before the test. And for Mod2 I was out mostly on roads which we had covered during the training, which helped immensely.\r\nCan't recommend them enough, very patient, level-headed, very good at helping me at build confidence with the bikes and on the road, great instruction.",

You could not be more ready for the tests after spending the course time with these instructors. Passed first time out in the most appalling weather conditions. Rob and Shane's attendance with us on test day was confidence inspiring and helped a great deal with the nerves. A school by bikers for bikers. From the excellent and seamless administration by the lovely Tina, supportive assessment of my riding ability by Ozzie to the instruction by Rob, I cannot recommend them more.",

Nathan was really supportive and informative as a teacher, when I was doing the DAS course and his approach really worked for me. Some comments have said the training area is too small. But when you're doing DAS if you can manage the manoeuvres there, the proper mod1 set up is a really easy.

            "My experience with stadium rider has been incredible from the quick and easy response to fantastic training from Mike himself who knows exactly what you need to do and where you need to improve would recommend to any family friends and whoever wants to do any sort of course regarding a motorbike this is the place to go. When I was searching to take on direct access I really couldn't find proper reviews to imagine some sort of insight to what I should expect. My experience started when I was told by a friend of mine about the law changing in January 19th I got scared as it was going to affect me as I am only 22. My mate passed restricted licence first time and recommended me to stadium riders. I spoke to Mike and he was very helpful to what I needed to do and was straight up with what to expect. For the price it was a bargain as everyone else out there was charging 700+ I got it for 580 that includes 3 sessions for training and in between module 1 and 2. Purely because of Mike's teaching skills I also passed first time and now I can't wait to get my first bike:) As for training I was dreading it as I have minimum experience on a bike but Mike's thorough training regimes where extraordinary and the way any student can pick up the skills needed was what every rider who wants to do their test needs. Mike can easily point out what needs to be done and work on weak points for best possible outcome. Advice for any student as long as you take on board what the trainer says and don't show no arrogance 'thinking you know everything you will pass'. Also I was so nervous for module 1 and 2 but Mike's helpful pet talks done the job and he tells you what to expect, also he go through every single obstacle that may pop up in the test.Thanks Mike for a great experience and teachings, appreciate your patience and  skills and can't wait till we go Brighton for fish and chips :)",

They were very enthusiastic when talking about bikes and their years of experience certainly showed when they gave me and each person there helpful tips with the little things some of us struggled with.

They stuck with me and made sure that I understood what they were teaching. The bikes appeared to be brand new and were a pleasure to ride.

Both took the time on a cold January morning to make sure all 6 students were catered for effectively.\r\nThere was some clear differences in level of student ability but the instructors helped those that needed through. \r\n1 fault that almost lost a star.... No coffee no milk and no loo roll to help stop my nose running as it was so cold 😂\r\nWill return to complete my full license as soon a possible. Thanks guys",

In a few months I will be looking to do my full Bike licence and I will  100%  consider the phoenix school.
