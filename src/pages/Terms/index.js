          <h3>4 Booking process</h3>
          <p>
            4.1 When any motorcycle learner wishes to book motorcycle training
            through our RideTo website they will submit a booking request to us,
            via the RideTo website, setting out their preferred date, time and
            location for the motorcycle training. We will check all Partner
            Training Schools' availabilities and match the motorcycle learner
            with a suitable Partner Training School in the location where they
            are based and based on their request and training needs and our
            knowledge of the various DVSA approved Partner Training Schools in
            the United Kingdom and in the location where the motorcycle learner
            resides.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.2 If we deem you a "match" with a motorcycle learner you will be
            notified via email with full details of the learner and the
            motorcycle training they require.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.3 Once we have confirmed the booking with you, we will send the
            motorcycle learner a booking confirmation and take payment for the
            applicable training course from the motorcycle learner.
          </p>
          <h3>5 Charges</h3>
          <p>
            5.1 In consideration of you complying with these Terms and providing
            motorcycle training to motorcycle learners we may introduce you to,
            we will pay an agreed normal rate less a flat commission fee to your
            bank account nominated in accordance with paragraph 5.11 below.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.2 You acknowledge and accept that we will not make any payment to
            you until we are in receipt of the requisite cleared funds from the
            applicable motorcycle learner and the motorcycle training has been
            successfully booked and completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.3 We will endeavour to make payment to you on the day of the
            training, but you acknowledge this may not always be possible and is
            not a valid reason for not completing any training.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.4 When the motorcycle learners have purchased a block full
            motorcycle licence training of 2, 3, 4 or 5 days, we will pay you
            for the lessons in installments as the lessons progress and subject
            to each lesson being delivered and successfully completed. Each
            day's payment will, where possible, be paid on the day of that
            scheduled training.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.5 Unless otherwise agreed between us in writing all payments made

          <p>
            5.6 When a payment is made to you we will send you an email
            confirming payment has been made.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.7 We may refuse to make any payment to you if we have reasonable
            grounds to suspect fraud, a breach of these Terms by you (or anyone
            on your behalf) or a violation of law. If we refuse to make a
            payment, you will be notified, unless it is unlawful for us to do
            so, or would compromise reasonable security measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.8 You are not permitted to accept payment directly from any
            motorcycle learner to whom you have received a referral from us
            under any circumstances. All payments to you in connection with your
            Engagement will be in accordance with the procedure set out in these
            Terms.

          <p>
            5.9 It is your responsibility to review any payments owed to you and
            to ensure that they are accurate and up to date. Any disputes about
            any payments owed to you for the provision of your training courses,
            must be communicated to us in writing by no later than 3 months from
            the date the training has been provided, failing which any such
            payments will be forfeited. Please email us at hello@rideto.com if
            you believe any payment is incorrect or has not been received.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.10 We may, at any time, without limiting our other rights and
            remedies under this Engagement, set off any amount owing to us by
            you against any amount payable by us to you.

            other than your own as a result of any incomplete or incorrect
            information you have provided to us.

          <h3>6 Cancellations and refunds</h3>
          <p>
            6.1 If, for any acceptable reason (being for the avoidance of doubt,
            adverse weather conditions), you have to cancel training with a
            motorcycle learner you must provide us with as much notice as
            possible by sending us an email to: hello@rideto.com. If the
            cancelled training is not rescheduled within 7 days of your
            notification to us we will, within our sole discretion and option:
            (i) take steps to recover the applicable payment due to us from you;
            or (ii) deduct the applicable payment due to us from your next
            payment. In the event of cancellation for any other reason other
            than adverse weather conditions, you will remain and will be
            responsible for payment of the full payment due to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.2 If a motorcycle learner cancels any motorcycle training booked
            with you, for any reason, we will aim to notify you as soon as
            possible via the email address you have provided to us. If we notify
            you more than 3 days before the training is due to start or in the
            case of full licence training, more than 8 days before the training,
            we will refund the motorcycle learner in full and no payment will be
            due to you or to us. If we notify you 3 days or less before the
            training is due to start or in the case of full licence training,
            less than 8 days before the training you are entitled to retain the
            applicable monies paid to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.3 If a motorcycle learner requests a refund from us in connection
            with a motorcycle training course booked with you and the reason for
            that request is directly attributable to any actions or omissions by
            your training school or any of your instructors (whether through
            tardiness, unprofessionalism or otherwise) we will notify you as
            soon as possible via the email address you have provided to us. In
            such circumstances we reserve the right to deduct the applicable
            monies from your next payment.

          <p>
            13.1 These Terms are a direct agreement between us and you may not
            assign, transfer or deal in any other manner with any or all of your
            rights or obligations under them to any third party or agent.
          </p>
          <p>
            13.2 "Force Majeure" means an event or sequence of events beyond our
            reasonable control preventing or delaying us from performing our
            obligations. We will not be liable if delayed in or prevented from
            performing our obligations under these Terms due to Force Majeure.
          </p>
          <p>
            13.3 A waiver of any right under these Terms or law is only
            effective if it is in writing and shall not be deemed to be a waiver
            of any subsequent breach or default. No failure or delay by a party
            in exercising any right or remedy provided under these Terms or by
            law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy,
            nor shall it prevent or restrict its further exercise of that or any
            other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right
            or remedy shall prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or
            any other right or remedy.

          <p>
            13.4 If any provision or part provision of these Terms is or becomes
            invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be deemed modified to
            the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and
            enforceable. If such modification is not possible, the relevant
            provision or part provision shall be deemed deleted. Any
            modification to or deletion of a provision or part provision under
            this paragraph shall not affect the validity and enforceability of
            the rest of the Terms.

            duplicate original, but all the counterparts shall together

            these Terms, they (and any dispute or claim arising out of or in
            connection with this Engagement) shall be governed by and construed
            in accordance with the law of England and Wales and we both
            irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have
            exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of
            or in connection with this Engagement or any disputes regarding
